        <p>Apollo’s story begins in the most heartbreaking way. He was discovered trembling in a bush, suffering from
          severe mange and eye infections so intense that they had left him blind. A completely feral cat, Apollo was
          in such a desperate state that rescuers were able to corner him and scoop him up. His pain was unimaginable,
          and he was lost, not knowing how to escape his torment. The rescue team immediately began treating his mange
          on the way home.</p>

          A vet visit brought devastating news: it was likely that Apollo would lose his sight entirely due to
          the infection. This was a crushing blow for everyone involved. But Apollo’s blindness unexpectedly
          became a tool for the team. It allowed them to make strides in socializing him, a process that would
          take time and patience. They found that their biggest breakthroughs happened during the daily cleaning
          sessions, as Apollo struggled to use the litter box. His reluctance helped soften his tough exterior,
          and, over time, his true personality began to emerge.</p>

          Five months later, Apollo was completely healed—and in a stunning twist, his left eye survived the
          infection. Although his vision isn’t perfect, he’s no longer fully blind. Because of his disability, the
          team decided to make Apollo a permanent resident. They discovered that he had an extraordinary love for
          kittens. Now, Apollo plays a vital role in the sanctuary, helping newly rescued kittens adjust to their new
          lives, offering them comfort, love, and companionship as they settle in.</p>

        <p>One quiet afternoon, Reece and Juliet found a small magpie lying on the ground, weak and alone. They
          could see she had fallen from her nest and, with no hesitation, brought her home and named her Molly. The
          young magpie was fragile, frightened, and unsure of her new environment, but Reece and Juliet were
          determined to help her. Every day they nursed her, providing care and patience, hoping that Molly would
          grow stronger and survive.</p>

          an unlikely bond began to form. Peggy took on a nurturing role, guiding Molly with a maternal
          tenderness that helped the magpie feel safe in her new home. </p>

          together, fast asleep. Molly, once a frightened orphan, had found a family in Peggy, and in the process, a
          deep and lasting bond formed between the two. Now, Molly lives peacefully with Reece, Juliet, and Peggy,
          her once-uncertain life filled with love, companionship, and the protection of her loyal friend.</p>

      <div class="storyalign1">
        <img src="./homepage/img/pigstory1.png" id="pigimg1">
        <p>One day, the team at Sisu Refuge received an urgent call about a piglet found abandoned on the side of the
          road. While being transported with her family, the tiny piglet had fallen from the truck—shaken, malnourished,
          and terrified. Fearing she might not survive, the refuge took her in and named her Marley. Over the next few
          days, Marley showed signs of recovery—eating, but only fruit punch, refusing vital milk replacement. She was
          also deeply depressed, withdrawn, and unwilling to play.</p>

        <p class="animated-text">
          Within a week Marley was becoming slightly more rambunctious, but her feeding her was becoming more
          challenging. She still refused milk replacement. In an effort to get her to eat it, the refuge would
          mix fruit punch with the milk. But Marley started to dislike the fruit punch flavors, so they
          sanctuary had to start experimenting with new flavors that Marely would eat. Once they figure that
          issue out, Marley became even more picky and wouldn’t eat any formula that wasn’t a specific
          temperature. They refuge was running out of options for Marley, as she wasn’t eating as much as she
          should.</p>

          Desperate to help her, the refuge reached out to Critter Creek Farm Sanctuary. The farm had recently
          welcomed a young calf, Eli, who was also struggling with grief after being separated from his mother.
          The team decided to introduce the two, hoping they might comfort one another. From the moment they met,
          Marley and Eli formed an unbreakable bond. They began playing, sleeping, and eating together—growing
          stronger and happier every day. The connection between the two was so profound that Critter Creek Farm
          decided to adopt them both permanently. Together, Marley and Eli now live a joyful life, side by side,
          forever—two unlikely friends whose love and healing saved them both.</p>
